# node-mail-warning
E-Mails you a warning as soon as your website goes down.

Built with Node.js and the Nodemailer module. <br/>
I'm planning to develop a UI for this app with Vue.js. 

Usage:

1. Clone project <br/>
2. Add your server configuration in server.js <br/>
3. Add your website URL in monitor.js <br/>
4. Configure your E-Mail (account, content of the message etc.) in mailer.js <br/>
5. Run with 'node run server.js'
